					<h2>Our Bloggers</h2>
					&ldquo;Many blogs focus on a particular topic, such as web design, home staging, sports, or mobile technology. Some are more eclectic, presenting links to all types of other sites. And others are more like personal journals, presenting the author's daily life and thoughts.
					
					Generally speaking (although there are exceptions), blogs tend to have a few things in common &ldquo;

					<h2>Preamble of our constitution</h2>
					<p>
						&ldquo;
						We, the people of Bangladesh, having proclaimed our independence on the 26th day of March, 1971 and through 2[ a historic struggle for national liberation], established the independent, sovereign People's Republic of Bangladesh; 
						
						3[ Pledging that the high ideals of nationalism, socialism, democracy and secularism, which inspired our heroic people to dedicate themselves to, and our brave martyrs to sacrifice their lives in, the national liberation struggle, shall be the fundamental principles of the Constitution;] 
						
						Further pledging that it shall be a fundamental aim of the State to realise through the democratic process a socialist society, free from exploitation a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice, political, economic and social, will be secured for all citizens; 
						
						Affirming that it is our sacred duty to safeguard, protect and defend this Constitution and to maintain its supremacy as the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh so that we may prosper in freedom and may make our full contribution towards international peace and co operation in keeping with the progressive aspirations of mankind; 
						
						In our Constituent Assembly, this eighteenth day of Kartick, 1379 B.S., corresponding to the fourth day of November, 1972 A.D., do hereby adopt, enact and give to ourselves this Constitution.

								<b>Rafsanur Rahman Rakib</b> I’m interested in computer science, music, sport and fantasy literature. Computers first appered in my life when I was seven. Then I had got my first computer.
